      <div class="mt-3 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-7">
        <p>Buying and selling surfboards should be easy and fun. But right now, it’s not.</p>
        <p>Most surfers are stuck using Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist to find their next board. Those platforms weren’t built for surfers. They’re cluttered, full of scammers, and expose too much personal info.</p>
        <p><strong>QuiverShare</strong> is my attempt to fix that. It’s a purpose-built marketplace just for surfboards, where you can browse, buy, and sell safely, with listings that actually capture the details that matter to surfers.</p>
        <p>The goal is that one day, you can land in a new surf town, open QuiverShare, and find a used board nearby that fits your style perfectly.</p>
        <p>And beyond convenience, there’s a bigger reason: Surfboards are expensive to make and tough on the environment. If we make it easier to <strong>resell and reuse</strong>, we help reduce waste while keeping great boards in the water, not in your garage.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Who’s Behind It</h2>
      <div class="mt-3 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-7">
        <p>I’m Jack a surfer and software developer based in New York City.</p>
        <p>I’ve owned more than 30 boards over the years, buying and selling from just about every platform imaginable. I surf all over the East Coast, from Montauk to the OBX, and I’ve always loved trying out new shapes and designs.</p>
        <p>Building QuiverShare is my way of combining that obsession with my love for building software, creating the kind of tool I’ve always wanted for myself (and hopefully for you too).</p>
